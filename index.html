<h2>Devotional Life</h2>
<p>He was initiated by Srila Prabhupada in 1973 at the age of 20 years as Aindra Dasa. He was a pujari for a long time and used to do book distribution and Harinam Sankirtan on the streets of New York for about 8 years. 

    He would go out on streets in New York and do Hare Krishna Mahamantra sankirtan for 8-12 hours on a daily basis.</p> 
    <p>This was for a period of about 8 years between 1973 to 1981-82
    
        He came to Vrindavan for the first time in 1982. The first time he came here, all his luggage and money got stolen right in the bus to Vrindavan. He then later went to Mayapur for some time and before returning back to the US. In 1986, he came here and re-started the 24 Hour Sankirtan (which was originally started by Srila Prabhupada)</p>

<p>The story of how 24-hour kirtan re-started is rather interesting and very inspiring. Aindra Prabhu during that period was seeking sincere answers on the inner confidential aspects of vraja-prema-bhakti and had read a scriptural reference that anybody who dies (actually gives up the body) in the Yamuna is bound to go back to Goloka Vrindavan.

    He was so hell-bent on getting the answers amongst all the chaos that he started his walk to Yamuna Maharani for leaving his body, but along the way, he got a voice within him telling to revive and restart the 24-hour Hare Krishna kirtan which Srila Prabhupada had inaugurated earlier.
    
    Aindra Prabhu came back and restarted the 24-hour kirtan single-handedly by the mercy of Sri Vrindavan Dham and Prabhupada.</p>

<p>Having almost no support, he wore a payal (anklet) to give the effect of kartal (cymbals), played his harmonium and sang his heart out for 16-18 hours on a daily basis before more devotees got inspired and assisted him. In initial days, there was no mridanga player so Aindra Prabhu would ask any vrajvasi baba visiting mandir for taking darshan of Radha Shyamsundar to play mridanga with him. The baba would be like, "but I don't know how to play it." Aindra Prabhu was like, "Just beat it however you like or do dum dum dum". That's how the 24-hour kirtan restarted!

    By the effect of Aindra Prabhu's shudh harinam sankirtan, anybody who does kirtan at Krishna Balaram Mandir in Vrindavan by default engages in shudh harinam sankirtan!</p>

<p>A lot of general masses and devotees who come at Krishna Balarama Mandir often are seen unable to hold back their tears while participating in sankirtan and taking darshan of Gaur Nitai, Krishna Balarama, and Radha Shyamsundar.

    Evening sankirtan during the time period of 7 PM - 8.45 PM at Krishna Balarama Mandir is surcharged as a lot of devotees prefer to visit in the evening time. As there is an assembly of a lot of devotees crying their hearts out, the kirtan is euphoric and one can't usually resist participating in it and dancing ecstatically.</p>

<h2>Shaligram Shilas</h2>

<p>Most of the Shaligram Shila in his room was left by devotees. He had brought around 100 shaligram shila from Nepal, and henceforth all the shilas were left over by unknown devotees in front of his room.</p>
<p>Slowly, there were over 1200 shilas in his room and he would take care of each of them personally.</p>
<p>He states that "Krishna has come to me by his own will, how can I refuse to serve him." Eventually, as the number of shilas went up, there would be an announcement in the temple for devotees not to leave Shaligram Shila at Aindra Prabhu's room door.</p>
